          @{{author}} üîç Important: PR Classification Needed!

          For efficient project management and a seamless review process, it's essential to classify your PR correctly. Here's how:

          1. If you're fixing a bug, label it as kind/bug.
          2. For small tweaks (less than 20 lines without altering any functionality), please use kind/improvement.
          3. Significant changes that don't modify existing functionalities should be tagged as kind/enhancement.
          4. Adjusting APIs or changing functionality? Go with kind/feature.

          For any PR outside the kind/improvement category, ensure you link to the associated issue using the format: ‚Äúissue: #<issue-number>‚Äù.

          Thanks for your efforts and contribution to the community!.
